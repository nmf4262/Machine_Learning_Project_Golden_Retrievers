# Machine_Learning_Project_Golden_Retrievers
Monte Fernandez and Anwar Benmallouk
The goal of this project is to use machine learning algorithms to predict if a dog has a parasite or not. The data set we use to create the models is on the dogs blood and other characteristics and the data is under the file "CBC_data.csv". We use three different methods to create the models, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, And Neural Networks.
